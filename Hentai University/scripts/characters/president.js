				sp president; I don't pay much attention to hackney pseudoscience, nor do I have any free time to waste.
				sp player; Well, being skeptical in moderation can be healthy, but being open to new experiences is also important.
				sp president; I'll be open anytime to ideas that actually have some merit, or are at least realistic. Hypnosis? What's next, you'll scream at me to scare away my imperfections? You'll guess my weight based on the alignment of the stars?

				t With no sign of danger you relax and stretch the tension away. 
				sp player; Ah, I really should get out more. How about you presidentF? It feel stuffy in here? 
				sp president; ... yeah. 
				sp player; That outfit in particular looks a lot more uncomfortable than the usual uniform. I bet it really feels like a heat is building up inside you. Which part of it feels the stuffiest? 
				sp president; It's... Down there...
				sp player; It's building up, isn't it? Show me.
				t Everybody has a different reaction to being hypnotized. presidentF's slow speech is pretty typical, but her sense of self is astoundingly strong. She's acting with dignity and stoicism, even as she's hypnotized, still tired, and... 
				im images/president/corruption.jpg
				t Completely exposed. 
				sp player; How do you feel?
				sp president; ... Warm.
				t It's a promising reaction, but you need a thread to tug at if you want to start unraveling her defenses. As it stands you could potentially have some fun, but that risks her breaking free. Plus that doesn't actually help you with the PTAS.
				sp player; Hmm... Warm, huh? Is that because I can see you? Because you've got your pussy exposed?
				sp president; ... Yes.
				sp player; Interesting. And how would you feel if others could see you too?
				t She shudders, a perfectly serviceable answer.
				sp player; And what do you do when you feel this way? When you feel this heat coursing through your body.
				sp president; ... I ignore it.<br> ... I focus on my work.
				sp player; You just ignore it?<br>I see. This'll require some creative problem solving. First off, let's have you relax those inhibitions. That's always a good place to start. You need to find yourself a healthier outlet, a way to let out all that pent-up energy. You need to feel... <b>Liberated.</b>

				sp player; Welcome back. Have a nice trip in dreamland? You should head home and get a good night's rest. Have you thought about what I said? About finding an outlet for your stress?
				sp president; What you... Oh, yes *sir.<br>... I'll ask around. Thank you.
				t Though you didn't actually talk to her about it while she was awake, her brain will do most of the heavy lifting for you now that the seed has been planted.

				sp principal; It's an incredible expression of the artistic talent of one of our top students. It should stay, at the very least for today. I may have it moved to my office if it serves as too much of a distraction.
				t And as you manage to push your way through the crowd, a large percentage of the inner circle crowding the entrance being male, you can hear two people fervently arguing.
				sp treasurer; Please, ma'am, please tell me this is a joke!
				sp president; It isn't. I-<br>playerF! Over here!
				t The crowd parts a little as presidentF beckons you over. As you make your way up the school's main staircase you can finally see what all the fuss is about.

				t In full glory, a large oil painting hangs upon the wall for everyone to see. A nude painting of presidentF with a plaque at the bottom denoting this as a self-portrait.

				t As you stuff her with cum, it's clear she's already picturing being used for twisted, yet deeply satisfying means. Whether it's the hypnosis or her own weakness, she's made her choice between you and the students she represents.

				t As the two of you get dressed she looks almost giddy, like a child who's just stolen something. Her straight-laced nature has come to an end, you clearly have a newly-formed degenerate on your hands.

				sp player; I do, but it's a practical one instead of a fun one. Keep your exhibitionism in check for now. I know it'll be stifling, but until I have influence over the school other members of the faculty won't be as open to 'self expression' as they could be.

				sp president; Calm... Calm down.
				sp treasurer; No way... This is insane! That magic stuff was real? But it's fake! It's-

				sp treasurer; Th-that's not... What I...
				sp president; I had a whole speech prepared but I'm afraid you've arrived just as my train of thought derailed.<br>So, treasurerF, you've found us. What will you do?
				sp treasurer; I'll get him arrested, and I'll get you-
				sp president; Expelled? Arrested as well? He and I are together now, treasurerF.<br>I understand you're frightened, shocked, but I sent you that text for a reason. I want to make you a deal.
				t This is beginning to spiral out of your control, you didn't instruct presidentF to do any of this. This charisma is probably what got her elected though, she'll make a good president once you've taken over the school.
				sp treasurer; ... What is it?
				t It's not clear if she's staying out of some morbid fascination with her friend being railed on the table she works at, or if she thinks a deal is the only way to save presidentF, but she's clearly invested as presidentF pulls her closer to whisper something in her ear. A blush spreads across her face deep enough to make her look bright red.

				sp treasurer; This is degrading...
				sp president; It's a matter of being relaxed, right? Of course you'd be more comfortable naked.
				sp treasurer; Th-that's not how normal people feel while they're naked in public!
				sp president; Oh? Am I abnormal? You say it so negatively. I remember when you joined the council, you said I was "extraordinary".
				sp treasurer; You are! I-I mean-
				sp president; Just relax. Come, sit on my lap.
				sp treasurer; A-and you meant what you said, right? He's so slimy I bet he uses uncooked bacon as a hand towel, why would I trust him? 
				sp president; You joined this council because you trusted me, that's all I'm asking you to do. Have faith in what I see is a better future for the school.<br>Besides, I think you'll find this path is a lot more fun than the straight and narrow.
				sp treasurer; Just this once... Just this once, and he can't say anything? And you'll be here the whole time? If I can make it through this and still-

				t As presidentF's lips wrap around treasurerF's nipple, she looks at you to signal for you to start.

				sp treasurer; Ghh!
				t treasurerF grits her teeth and presidentF winces as you thrust in. You give her a moment to adjust while presidentF soothes treasurerF by fondling and licking her body, keeping her attention.
				t Thinking quickly you start timing slow thrusts like a mock metronome, pumping in and out as presidentF alternates between sucking on her friend's nipple and whispering suggestions into treasurerF's ear.
				sp president; Focus on me, treasurerF. Focus on how your heart races when you think of me, when you look at me, smell me.
				t presidentF whispers corruptive words of how good giving in will feel, but even more importantly what life will be like for the two of them, alone, in the student council room from now on.
				sp president; Let it flow through you, and everything you feel in your heart, is me. I am the one touching you, treasurerF. I am the one in front of you. Think of me, only me.
				t While treasurerF probably convinced her that you wouldn't try to hypnotize her, presidentF's soothing voice is doing that for you.
				t Slowly, treasurerF's gaze starts to unfocus. Her jaw unclenches. Her shoulders untense.
				sp president; Feel your heartbeat. Faster. Faster...
				t Thrusting in a rhythm begins to feel easier, in and out... In and out... You feel your eyes-
				sp president; Mmm? *Sir?
				t You feel yourself snap out of a light trance and you step back.
				im images/president/treasurerCorruption3.jpg
				t treasurerF is completely out of it, a full load in her cunt and another on her abdomen. You must've put yourself into a trance, presidentF actually has some strong talent as a hypnotist.
				t You wave your hand in front of treasurerF's face, and she barely responds.
				sp player; Nice, she's out. So, what did you actually tell her? That if she managed to make it without being hypnotised, I'd turn you back to normal?
				sp president; No, I told her that if she stayed in control that I'd be hers to do with as she pleased. 
				sp player; Oh, wow. You put a lot of faith into my performance.
				sp president; And you delivered. Now, I'll be spending the evening with treasurerF to make sure the work we did... <i>Sticks</i>. My goal is that when you and her are... Relaxing... That she'll see you as me. I'll see you again?
